# cementStrengthPrediction
we have to identify the how much pressure can handle one meter cube of that concrete block


### our problem statement is to predict the compressive strength of a cement block

### compressive strength: **how much pressure that one meter cube of that concrete block can handle**

### why we need this ?
**if you are building something very tall building, bridges. they need to handle lot of pressure
	in that case if the block is not going to good. then your structure wont be durable . they wont be able
	bear the road that they are design to bear. that's the reason we need compressive strength of cement.
  problem statement is based on quantity of different materials**
